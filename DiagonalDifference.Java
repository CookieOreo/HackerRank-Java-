Problem Statement:

Given a square matrix of size N Ã— N, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N lines denote the matrix's rows, with each line containing N space-separated integers describing the columns.

Output Format:
Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input:

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
Sample Output

15

Explanation

The primary diagonal is: 
11
    5
       -12

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:
      4
   5
10

Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19 
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15
